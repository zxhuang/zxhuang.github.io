<h1>Here are some of my mini side projects:</h1>

<h2>(1)&nbsp;<a href="http://zxhuang.github.io/raspberry-pi-motion-alert/">Raspberry Pi Motion Alert System&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;Home Security Surveillance</h2>

<p>Uses motion, Google Drive and SMS email to detect, record, upload and alert motions at home when you are out. I open source the code on github http://zxhuang.github.io/raspberry-pi-motion-alert/. Feel free to fork it smile emoticon Project&nbsp;</p>

<h2>(2) Pandora Radio Streaming</h2>

<p>Mainly for my son to listen toddler music all day long.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>(3) Remote-Controlled Switch Project</h2>

<p>Part of my Xmas lighting show project, but right now it just a simple RC switch using a relay board and a RFRC that I bought from HomeDepot for $20. So that I can turn lights on and off from any where through SSH tunnel.</p>
