    Raspberry Pi Motion Alert System
</a>
Some friends asked what do I use my Raspberry Pi for. Here are 3 of my mini projects:
(1) Home Security Surveillance Camera
(2) Pandora Radio Streaming
(3) Remote-Controlled Switch
Project (1) uses motion, Google Drive and SMS email to detect, record, upload and alert motions at home when you are out. I open source the code on github http://zxhuang.github.io/raspberry-pi-motion-alert/. Feel free to fork it smile emoticon
Project (2) is mainly for my son to listen toddler music all day long.
Project (3) is part of my Xmas lighting show project, but right now it just a simple RC switch using a relay board and a RFRC that I bought from HomeDepot for $20. So that I can turn lights on and off from any where through SSH tunnel.
